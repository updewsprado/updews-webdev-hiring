                    <h2>Glaisa Quijano</h2>
                    <h4>Associate in Information Technology</h4>
                    <p>My name is Glaisa Quijano and I graduated from Trimex Institute of Science and Technology. I am seeking for a Junior Web Developer position. I have been taking up short courses and training to prepare myself for my new career as a Web developer.</p>
                    <p>I am a hard-working person. As a matter of fact, I studied while having my regular work in Electronics Company. I am also confident that I can work effectively under pressure and can also adapt to any sudden changes that may happen during the course of my work.</p>
                    <p>Having good interpersonal skill is one my strengths. I can work well with others and always open to various opinions and ideas. I have a strong keen on continues learning which I can use in my job. I am also a fast-learner person.</p>
                    <p>My weakness is having too much curiosity. I always wanted to learn or know something. I can't stop until I figure it out. I tend to forget the time, and sacrifices my sleep or my meals. As a result, I always have headaches and backpain. In able to cope with that, I set my alarm to remind myself.</p>
